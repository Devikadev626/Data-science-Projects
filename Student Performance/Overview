student Performance Prediction using Machine Learning
This is my first Machine Learning project!
It predicts student performance (final exam score) based on feature study hours  using a Linear Regression model.

📂 Project Files
linreg.ipynb — Jupyter Notebook containing data analysis, model training, and evaluation.
Student-Performance.csv — Dataset used for model training and testing.
student_performance-LR.pkl — Saved trained Linear Regression model.

🧠 Model Details
Algorithm: Linear Regression
Libraries Used: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
Input Features: Study hours
Output: Predicted Student Score

student-performance-linear-regression
